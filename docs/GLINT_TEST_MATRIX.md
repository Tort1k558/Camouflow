# Glint browser test matrix

Living test register. Update after every linked Glint build; keep previous build
results rather than replacing them. A planned check is not a passing result.

## Test destinations

Priority: **Core** for each build; **Extended** before release; **Reference** for
research. Availability and detector behavior must be rechecked at test time.

| Service | What to inspect | Priority | Evidence to retain |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [CreepJS](https://abrahamjuliot.github.io/creepjs/) | JS API inconsistencies, Canvas, Audio, fonts, workers | Core | Report, reported lies and context differences |
| [Pixelscan](https://pixelscan.net/) | Fingerprint/environment consistency and network observations | Core | Exact findings, configuration and screenshot |
| [BrowserScan](https://www.browserscan.net/bot-detection) | Automation signals; use other sections for IP, WebRTC and fingerprint | Core | Bot verdict and individual signals |
| [Sannysoft](https://bot.sannysoft.com/) | WebDriver, headless and automation indicators | Core | Every individual check, not only green tiles |
| [BrowserLeaks](https://browserleaks.com/) | Canvas, WebGL, WebRTC, fonts and Client Hints | Core | Surface values and repeat/context comparisons |
| [IPhey](https://iphey.com/) | Browser and network consistency | Core | Individual findings and route label |
| [Fingerprint Playground](https://demo.fingerprint.com/playground) | Visitor recognition and available bot/tampering signals | Core | Same-profile revisit and different-profile observations |
| [Rebrowser Bot Detector](https://bot-detector.rebrowser.net/) | Automation/CDP-related behavior | Core | Individual tests; manual-only checks remain unverified |
| [Incolumitas](https://bot.incolumitas.com/) | Headless, API and behavioral bot checks | Core | Individual findings and observation duration |
| [Device and Browser Info](https://deviceandbrowserinfo.com/are_you_a_bot) | Browser automation indicators | Core | Individual flags, browser mode and CDP connection state |
| [TLS Peet](https://tls.peet.ws/) | TLS/HTTP fingerprints, including available JA3/JA4 data | Core | Browser-originated request; compare same-route stock Chrome |
| [IPify](https://api.ipify.org/?format=json) | Actual browser request egress | Core | Private expected-egress comparison; redact public IPs |
| [BrowserLeaks WebRTC](https://browserleaks.com/webrtc) | ICE candidates and address exposure | Core | Compare with expected proxy route; redact addresses |
| [DNS leak test](https://www.dnsleaktest.com/) | Resolver exposure during browser requests | Extended | Resolver observations; distinguish proxy and OS behavior |
| [Cover Your Tracks](https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/) | Tracking protection and fingerprint uniqueness in its sample | Extended | Sample size/date; uniqueness is not a bot verdict |
| [AmIUnique](https://amiunique.org/) | Fingerprint uniqueness in its participating population | Extended | Sample/date; results are population-dependent |
| [Fingerprint Demo](https://fingerprint.com/demo/) | Vendor demo entry point and visitor recognition | Extended | Record actual redirected destination and enabled product |
| [PrivacyTests](https://privacytests.org/) | Published browser privacy comparisons and test methodology | Reference | Not an interactive Glint certification; run applicable source tests separately |

## CAPTCHA destinations

| Service | Test | Priority | Acceptance boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Google reCAPTCHA demos](https://recaptcha-demo.appspot.com/) | Available v2 checkbox/invisible examples | Extended | Record challenge outcome and actual backend response separately |
| [Google reCAPTCHA v3 scores](https://recaptcha-demo.appspot.com/recaptcha-v3-request-scores.php) | Official sample score request | Core | Backend success, score, action and hostname; sample score is not production quality |
| [Google reCAPTCHA v2](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo) | Manual checkbox/challenge flow | Extended | Widget completion alone is not server verification |
| [Cloudflare Turnstile demo](https://demo.turnstile.workers.dev/) | Widget and integration smoke check | Core | Check current key/source: dummy keys cannot demonstrate real anti-bot acceptance |
| [Turnstile testing documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/troubleshooting/testing/) | Controlled pass/fail integration fixtures | Reference | Separate guaranteed dummy outcomes from real production keys |
| [hCaptcha developer guide](https://docs.hcaptcha.com/) | Authorized controlled widget and backend verification | Extended | Requires a controlled deployment; test keys prove integration only |

Real Turnstile managed/non-interactive, hCaptcha and reCAPTCHA acceptance tests
require an authorized deployment with real keys and backend verification. Until
available, mark them **Not verified**, not PASS. Do not use paid solvers, token
substitution or unrelated account workflows. Do not publish CAPTCHA tokens,
secret keys, proxy credentials or identifying fingerprint payloads.

## Repeatable run protocol

1. Record build ID, Chromium version, applied patch range, executable/core-DLL
   hashes, date, Windows version and policy configuration.
2. Run headed manual, headed automation and headless automation separately.
   Record CDP connected/disconnected state and effective launch arguments.
   Do not use JS API overrides or framework stealth flags as engine evidence.
3. Test the direct route and each configured proxy separately, using disposable
   profiles. Direct means no configured browser proxy, not necessarily no VPN.
   Verify HTTPS egress and DNS/WebRTC expectations without a direct fallback.
4. Compare with unmodified Chrome under the same route and mode. Repeat at least
   three times; compare same-profile restart and separate-profile observations.
5. Save raw reports/screenshots privately, then add a redacted results section
   below. Keep screenshot failures separate from detector observations.
6. Use **Observed**, **Failed**, **Unavailable**, **Not run**, or **Not verified**.
   Never convert a timeout, missing field or test-key CAPTCHA into PASS.

## Build history

### Windows development baseline 001–010 — 2026-10-12

Chromium **148.0.7778.96**; executable SHA-256:
`61e97ba3335f64836b3abcf93d67af0d6ddd0d06c291b4592b1448643b35e222`.
Headless automation, no JS API overrides; CLI automation masking suppressed.
One observational round, not the complete repeatable protocol above.

| Check | Direct | SOCKS5 route 1 | SOCKS5 route 2 | SOCKS5 route 3 | Limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BrowserScan bot detection | Observed: Normal | Observed: Normal | Observed: Normal | Observed: Normal | Route 2 screenshot failed; DOM observation available |
| Fingerprint Playground | Observed: bot/tampering/devtools not detected | Same observation | Same observation | Same observation | Not a complete tracking/isolation test |
| Official reCAPTCHA v3 sample | Observed: backend success, score 0.9 | Not verified | Not verified | Not verified | Proxy backend responses absent within observation window; sample only |
| Real Turnstile / hCaptcha | Not verified | Not verified | Not verified | Not verified | No real-key authorized backend verification |
| Other destinations above | Not run | Not run | Not run | Not run | Pending expanded matrix |

Private evidence: `external-probes-strict-baseline-001-010/external-proxy-matrix.json`
in the external build workspace. Earlier framework-masked observations must not
be substituted for this strict round.

### Windows development candidate 001–015

Pending linked binary and runtime verification. No baseline result above applies
automatically to this candidate. Add dated results and measured hashes only after
the actual new binary completes its checks.

## Sources and maintenance

- [GitHub detector directory](https://github.com/TheGP/untidetect-tools): discovery only, not proof of Glint results.
- [Rebrowser detector source](https://github.com/rebrowser/rebrowser-bot-detector): automation checks and their prerequisites.
- [Google sample source](https://github.com/google/recaptcha/tree/master/examples): client and backend verification examples.
- [Cloudflare Turnstile demo source](https://github.com/cloudflare/turnstile-demo-workers): inspect current keys and backend behavior.
- [Cloudflare dummy-key rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/troubleshooting/testing/): fixture outcomes are not real challenge acceptance.

For every linked build, add a new build-history section with all Core checks,
including unavailable/not-run entries. Extended checks are required before a
release claim. This document is maintained alongside saved evidence; it is not
an automatic certification or an unattended scheduler.
